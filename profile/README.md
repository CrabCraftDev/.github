# 🦀 CrabCraft

**CrabCraft** is an ambitious **Minecraft server written in Rust**.
Built for speed, scalability, and modern development practices.

## 🚀 Vision

CrabCraft aims to be:

* **Fast and safe:** A Minecraft server powered by Rust’s performance and memory safety.
* **Developer-friendly:** Designed for developers & contributors, even outside the Rust ecosystem.
* **Collaborative and fun:** A project where developers can learn, grow, and build together.

We’re still in the early stages. Code will be published once the project reaches a point we’re proud to share. 

Benchmarks and comparisons with existing servers will follow later.

## 🛠️ Projects

CrabCraft is not just one program but a collection of tools and crates that form the ecosystem:

* **CrabCraft** — 🦀 The Rust-based Minecraft server. *(Rust)*
* [**CrabNBT**](https://github.com/CrabCraftDev/CrabNBT) — 📜 A modern Rust crate for intuitive NBT data handling. *(Rust)*
* **CrabExtractor** — 🚜 A simple mod for extracting Minecraft data. *(Java)*
* **CrabToolbox** — 🔧 Helper tools for faster CrabCraft development. *(Python)*
* [**CrabEvenio**](https://github.com/CrabCraftDev/CrabEvenio) — 🐄 An event-driven ECS framework. *(Rust)*

More components are planned or under development, but not yet public.
